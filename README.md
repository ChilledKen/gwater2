## Overview
**GWater2** Is a fluid simulation mod for Garry's Mod. It adds the ability to spawn and create a multitude of different fluids that flow in real time.\
Due to the complex nature of simulating and rendering fluid dynamics, the backend of this mod requires a binary module. See [Technical Details](#technical-details) for more information.

Installation steps can be found [here](#installation-steps)

## Features
**GWater2** comes with a bunch of SWEPs and Entities to mess with, and a menu to change fluid behavior.
Multiplayer is supported, and menu options (fluid parameters) are synced.

## Requirements
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to run **GWater2** You MUST have a DirectX11 capable graphics card

A capable card must have:\
`Nvidia Driver version 396.45` (or higher)\
OR\
`AMD Software version 16.9.1` (or higher)\
OR\
`Intel® Graphics version 15.33.43.4425` (or higher)

If this is all gibberish to you, essentially any graphics card manufactured later than 2012 will work just fine.

## Technical details
Unlike most other Garry's mod addons, **GWater2** uses a binary module. Although powerful, the default GLua API isn't able to do everything required to simulate and render fluid dynamics.
Backend particle physics is calculated via [Nvidia FleX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/FleX). A GPU accelerated particle system for liquids.
Custom shaders were created in HLSL, compiled using [ShaderCompile](https://github.com/SCell555/ShaderCompile), and are injected during runtime.
